# Marp Slide Template

This repository is created **for my own purposes**; nevertheless, you can always feel free to refer to the source if you really one. 

Here's a [peek](https://icheft.github.io/marp-template/) of the demo slide.

## Memo

Do include `.vscode` directory first in your local project (you can put `.vscode` in the `.gitignore` file later on).
